Optional Class
===============
	
	What is NullPointerException?
		When we don't initialize a reference variable, 
		a special value null is assigned to them.
		
		And when we try to use that UNINITIALIZED reference variable
		it throws NullPointerException
		
		
	In Java 8, the Optional class which provides an easier way to avoid 
	the NullPointerException was introduced.
	Optional class is a final class and is in java.util package
	It helps in writing neat and more readable code without using too many null checks.
	By using Optional instance,
		we can specify alternate values to return
		or alternate code to run
		
	Optional instance: A container object which may or maynot contain a non-null value
	
	
	Different ways of using Optional class
		1. Get the value
		2. Get if object is non-null, else throw exception
		3. Get if object is non-null, else return default
		4. Consume if it is not null
